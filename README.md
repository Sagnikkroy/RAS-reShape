# RAS-reShape
RAS-reShape is a CNN trained on Google QuickDraw sketches to recognize hand-drawn shapes like circles, rectangles, triangles, lines, and random doodles. Built for real-time raster shape beautification systems.

## Overview

**RAS-reShape** is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to recognize common hand-drawn shapes — such as circles, rectangles, triangles, and lines — in real time. It is part of a larger system that automatically beautifies shapes drawn on a canvas.

> The model also smartly ignores irregular, abstract doodles, making it ideal for creative apps and sketch-based UIs.

## 🧠 What It Recognizes

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| ![](media/draw_circle.gif) | ![](media/fix_circle.gif) |
| ![](media/draw_triangle.gif) | ![](media/fix_triangle.gif) |
| ![](media/draw_random.gif) | *Ignored* (no beautification) |

- `circle`
- `rectangle`
- `triangle`
- `line`
- `none` (random doodle)

## How It Works (Abstracted)

RAS-reShape learns from thousands of real human sketches using the [QuickDraw dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). The CNN model is trained to classify a sketch into one of five shape categories. Once a shape is confidently identified, it is "beautified" by replacing it with a mathematically perfect version in real time.

> If a drawing doesn’t resemble any shape, the model does nothing — maintaining the integrity of the original sketch.
